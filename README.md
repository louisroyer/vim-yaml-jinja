# Vim yaml-jinja syntax

This project is a fork of [Glench/Vim-Jinja2-Syntax](https://github.com/Glench/Vim-Jinja2-Syntax) allowing to have syntax coloration on yaml+jinja2 files.

Detection is based on file extension. Only yaml.j2 is supported by this plugin. If you want html, use upstream version.
